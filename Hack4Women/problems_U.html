                Overcrowding is a situation where a lot of people accumulate in a rather limited space that is unable to accommodate them 
                without succumbing to the pressures around it properly. As a result of urbanization, overcrowding is a persistent problem as a
                large number of people are consistently moving to urban areas on a daily basis.<br>

            <p style="color:blue;text-align:center;width:70%;text-align: left;">
                Unemployment is another urbanization problem. What is surprising is that a big percentage of youth who are unemployed belong to well raised and educated families. The job opportunities 
                might be more in urban areas and also pay more, but as the number of people continues to grow, the jobs become even harder to find and retain.

            <p style="color:blue;text-align:center;width:70%;text-align: left;">
                Housing problems tend to develop when people move to cities and overcrowd in them. If the cities were not well prepared for the numbers, the houses become more scarce. It is even harder to settle people who come to cities and don’t 
                end up getting employed or those who settle in as immigrants. Some of these people are unable to afford to build their own homes or even paying rent.<br>

            <div class="educ">
            <p style="color:blue;text-align:center;width:70%;text-align: left;">
                Sanitation problems are rampant in urban areas due to the overpopulation that is seen in many of the areas people settle. The local governments find it hard to properly set up and manage a proper sewerage system due to the rampant bulge of the human population. The fast increase in people’s population sometimes 
                overwhelms the local government’s resource capacity to construct the required sanitation and sewage systems.

        <p style="color:blue;text-align:center;width:70%;text-align: left;">
            Water is very important for sustaining life. The rampant growth of the population in
            urban areas makes the water very scarce as the normal supply becomes strained and inadequate to properly meet the demands of the large population.
