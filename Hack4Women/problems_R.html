                they definitely allow their child to get educated. The Solution for this Problem is making people aware of Education.

            <p style="color:blue;text-align:center;width:70%;text-align: left;">
                Women in rural India today face a problem of getting even the basic sanitation facilities. They are the victims of open defecation and also the diseases which are caused by it.
                Women are sometimes even prohibited from using the public toilets which are constructed by the government.

        <p style="color:blue;text-align:center;width:70%;text-align: left;">
            Women are given inferior status because they are considered to be a burden for the parents. 
            This is mainly due to the dowry practice that is rampant in the rural parts of India. 
            There is not a denial of the fact that dowry as the practice even exists in Urban and semi-urban regions
             but the women in urban areas are educated and alert enough to tackle the issue which is not the case for rural Indian women.
